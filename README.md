### Installation (Manual)

This method always works and gives you full control.

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   Go to the script file here on GitHub: [**melcoms_highlighter_with_x.js**](https://github.com/melcom-creations/melcoms_highlighter_with_x/blob/main/melcoms_highlighter_with_x.js)
    *   Click the **"Copy raw file"** icon (looks like two overlapping squares) in the top-right corner of the code view. This copies the entire script into your clipboard.

2.  **Add to Tampermonkey:**
    *   Open the **Tampermonkey Dashboard** in your browser. (You can do this by clicking the Tampermonkey extension icon and selecting "Dashboard").
    *   Click on the **`+`** tab (next to "Installed userscripts") to create a new script.

3.  **Paste and Save:**
    *   Delete all the template code that appears in the editor window.
    *   Paste the code you copied from GitHub into the now empty editor.
    *   Go to **File** -> **Save** in the editor menu (or press `Ctrl` + `S`).

That's it! The script is now installed and active.
