# Highlighter with X – A Tampermonkey Userscript

**Highlighter with X** is a compact userscript that lets you highlight any text on any webpage in yellow, green, or red. You can instantly remove a highlight with a hover-activated “×” button.

It’s perfect for marking up patch notes, articles, or forum posts. The script also automatically saves your highlights per page and restores them when you revisit.
